def is_k_incoherence(rho: np.ndarray, k: int) -> bool:
    r"""
    Determine whether a density matrix is $k$-incoherent.

    A density matrix :math:`\rho` is said to be *$k$-incoherent* if it can be expressed
    as a convex combination of pure states, each of which has support on at most
    :math:`k` basis vectors. In other words, each pure state in the mixture has at most
    :math:`k` non-zero entries when written in the reference basis.

    Equivalently, this is the same as requiring that the matrix :math:`\rho` has 
    factor width at most :math:`k`. This function checks whether such a decomposition 
    exists, and returns ``True`` if so, and ``False`` otherwise.

                       # A diagonal matrix is 1-incoherent (fully incoherent)
                       rho_diag = np.diag([0.5, 0.5])
                       print(is_k_incoherent(rho_diag, 1))
                       # True

                       # A state with off-diagonal coherence is not 1-incoherent
                       rho_coh = np.array([[0.5, 0.4],[0.4, 0.5]])
                       print(is_k_incoherent(rho_coh, 1))
                       # False
                       print(is_k_incoherent(rho_coh, 2))
                       # True

    The definition of k-incoherence can be found in :cite:`Nathaniel_2023_Tight`.
