def create_bcs_constraints(M: np.ndarray, b: np.ndarray) -> list[np.ndarray]:
    r"""Construct a list of constraints in tensor form for a binary constraint system (BCS) game.

    This function builds a list of constraints by converting each row of the binary matrix
    ``M`` of shape (m, n) and the corresponding element of the binary vector ``b``
    into an n-dimensional tensor of shape (2, 2, ..., 2) (one axis per variable).

    The conversion works as follows:
      1. For the i-th constraint, compute the constant value as ``rhs = (-1)**(b[i])``.
      2. Create an n-dimensional array (tensor) of shape ``(2,)*n`` filled with ``-rhs``.
      3. Compute the index from the first n entries of the i-th row of ``M`` by taking each value modulo 2.
      4. Set the tensor element at that index to ``rhs``.

    For example:
      If ``M[i] = [1, 1]`` and ``b[i] = 0`` (so ``rhs = 1``):
      - The tensor is of shape (2, 2) and is created as:
            [ [-1, -1],
              [-1, -1] ]
      - The index is computed as ``(1 % 2, 1 % 2) = (1, 1)``.
      - At position (1, 1), the value is set to 1, resulting in:
            [ [-1, -1],
              [-1,  1] ]

    This tensor now represents the constraint in full detail.

def generate_solution_group(M: np.ndarray, b: np.ndarray) -> tuple[list[int], list[int]]:
    r"""Generate a bitmask representation for a binary constraint system (BCS) game.

    This function converts each row of the binary matrix ``M`` into an integer bitmask,
    pairing it with the corresponding parity from ``b``. The bitmask representation
    can be useful for analyzing linear system games.

    This function checks if the binary constraint system defined by ``Mx = b``
    admits a perfect commuting-operator strategy. It converts the constraints
    to bitmask form, performs Gaussian elimination over :math:`\mathrm{GF}(2)`,
    and examines the resulting constraint graph for cycles that indicate a nontrivial
    solution.
